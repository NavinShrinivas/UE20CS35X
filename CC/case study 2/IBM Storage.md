## IBM File storage 
- IBM `File` storage is a POSIX compiant cloud file storage service, where the files can be accessed like typical local file system through NFS or SMB. 
- It provide high performance file storage like standard file system. 
- Such a file system is useful when a normal FS is to be shared across people. 
## Object storage 
- This type of storage is used for unstructured data. IBM by default provides high scalability and performance to objects. 
- Unlike block storage, Object storage doesn't need the low latency or structed queries. Hence Object storage aim more towards scalability.
- IBM by default also gives backup ,recovery and analytics on object storage. 
## Block storage 
- Used to store files in the fixed size of block, this helps with achieving very low latency and a higg degree of control. 
- This is often found in HPC and used to enterprise low latency database systems.
